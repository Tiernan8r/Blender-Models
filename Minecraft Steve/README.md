# BlenderModels
The various blend files in this folder represent the different ways to UV unwrap the minecraft player texture.
The Steve.blend file follows the old/original way of formatting the texture file.
The Minecraft_Steve_New_Format.blend takes into account the extra alpha data added to the image file with the new multiple arm textures but does not read the new texture section.
The Minecraft_Steve_Seperate_Arms.blend does read and display the new individual arms and legs texture on the model.
